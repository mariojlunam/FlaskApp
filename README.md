# Spatial Query APP

Example of a Flask App that retrieve data based in bbox built from 2 points,

It uses spatial functionality in the backend to return valid geojson that could be used to rendered on maps
or for different uses.

Usefull when you need to display data based on the userviewport of an app.

Data from OS OpenRoads will be served
to make this portable data is just served for Leeds and surrounding areas.
Please, select your points inside this area.

You can hit the api using the endpoints

QUERY IN 27700 OUTPUT 4326 (Input Coordinates in 27700 but output in 4326)
#results?x1=436139.8&y1=434547.0&x2=434141.2&y2=433689.0&srid=4326

QUERY IN 4326 IN
#results?x1=-1.481803254286913&y1=53.79827838458832&x2=-1.481861940752835&y2=53.80416168334681&srid=4326

Or use the the UI with the form provided.
Just go to your prefer map, select two points inside Leeds Area and fill the form with the coordinates.
Input the srid of your input coordinates, by default is 4326.

To visualise the ouput, if you selected 4326, copy the geojson returned and paste in https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20

You will see your vector features rendered on the area specified built by the two points

## Installation

If you are in LINUX there will be some problems with the spatialite extension.
For Windows the binaries for spatialite are setup to be integrated with the app at runtime

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd <repo location in your computer>
python -m virtualenv env
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd server
python main.py

```

## Usage

After running the above commands the flask server must be up and running.
Activate or install your env depends if you are in Linux or Windows.

You can also clone the repo open the folder in VSCode, and do the following

-Python: Create Environment
- Select your interpreter (Python 3.9 suits better)
- You will be asked to install the requirements txt file.
- You are ready to use the app. Run the server running the main.py file
```
